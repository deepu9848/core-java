Inheritance:
    extend the functionality of a class by creating a subclass. it is is-"a" relationship.
    example-class Drivers extends Persons because clsss driver inherit each and every object from parent class person.
            class driver "is" a subclass of person

Dependance:
    It is strong relation that one class totally depend upon other class
    one class can not carry out its work without other class
     it is uses "-a" relationship
    Example- one class is Building which uses a another class Room.

 Aggregation:
    this relation is one way relationship which is also called has "-a" relationship too.
    one class contain reference to another class
    Example- class Employee contains has object Address but address is itself class that
    contains city country zipcode etc. so we can call employee has class address

 Types of Inheritance
  Java supports the following four types of inheritance:

  1) Single Inheritance
  in single inheritance, a sub-class is derived from only one super class.
    Example-Class A derived from Class B
  2)Multi-level Inheritance
    Example-class A is derived from a class B which is also derived from another class C is called multi-level inheritance
  3)Hierarchical Inheritance
  If a number of classes are derived from a single base class, it is called hierarchical inheritance.
    Example- Both class A and Class B derived from Class C
  4)Hybrid Inheritance
    Hybrid inheritance is the combination of two or more types of inheritance.
     Example- class a derived from class B and class C and Class D derived from Class B.
